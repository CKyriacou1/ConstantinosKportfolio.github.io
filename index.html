My name is Konstantinos and I live in Cyprus ,Nicosia . I am looking forward to begin the data science program so that I can obtain the necessary knowledge to work as a data scientist in the future .It is a really challenging field for me as it combines programming and statistics which are in my opinion some of the most difficult but at the same time most interesting subjects."  /></a>
										<a href="images/gallery/fulls/02.jpg" class="image filtered span-1-5" data-position="center"><img src="images/gallery/thumbs/02.jpg" alt="Induction Module: The Importance of a Postgraduate Degree in the Computer Science Field

<p> As the current market shifts and alters in regards to the advancement of science and it’s fields, it is natural for masters applicants to shape an opinion regarding this change. As one of those applicants, I have chosen to focus on a data science degree as I’ve realized that the general field of computer science is a large component for the growth of our current market, and I wish to be a part of this development. My assignment covers investigation into this matter, as well as highlighting the reasoning of my personal choice.
In the academic paper of Vasant Dhar, ‘Data Science and Prediction’, various academic definitions are given. It is mentioned that science is the systemic approach to acquiring knowledge. Subsequently, data science is defined by Vasant Dharin in his article of ‘Data Science and Prediction’, as the focus of this systemic approach involving data as well as various other variables. These variables are defined by the author as different fields of science, as well as practices such as the systematic study of data , regarding its properties, organization and analysis , translating it into reliable deductions. The author insists that data science is a field separate of the previously mentioned variables and as such sets a need in the market for employment for individuals that have academic or previous experience within this field specifically, different from the previously stated. As such, the term computer science can be defined as the application of science within a computerized environment, using previously mentioned variables. 
It is stated in the article ‘data science and prediction’ by Vasant Dhar, that the correlation between these two sectors could be defined as the predictive accuracy used by computers. Consequently, it is natural to say that by using the information presented in the article, these two sectors are linked and specifically that one may encapsule the other as a subcategory within its own field. This article manages to formulate this connection as it states the core category to be computer science, as data science is stated to be the product of a surge of computer based collected data in the new age. 

The article used above, states that as databases expand, the constant need for education is apparent, as to handle most current matters regarding the field. In agreement to the previous statement, there is a constant need for the educating and employment of data scientists to be able to supply with these demands. Regarding this, the market has influenced universities and various other establishments to employ methods to educate potential candidates for these positions. Specifically speaking, throughout the previous article it is mentioned that the employment market for data scientists has increased within recent years, as noted within the article ‘Bridging the demand and the offer in data science’ by Adam S.Z. Belloum, Spiros Koulouzis, Tomasz Wiktorski and Andrea Manieri. With this in mind, I have formulated the decision of educating myself within this specific field as a means to acquiring a position in the data science field of employment.

Furthermore, in regards to this personal decision of studying within this field, an additional reason as to why I am currently seeking to pursue a masters degree in this field is stated in the ‘2015 data science salary survey’, written by King, J. and Magoulas, R., that relays the information that ‘the median annual base salary for a starting data scientist is $91,000’. This information relays to my person, that attaining a position within this field will provide me with financial security and potential for salary growth. Additionally, these figures according to the ‘2015 data science survey’ by King, J. and Magoulas, R., have been consistent over time. 

These elements were one of the defining factors in my decision to study data science as a master’s degree. Besides the previous stated fact, I chose this path as it offered a fixed set of hours in most employment positions, as referred to in the article by J.King and R.Magoulas, ‘2015 data science survey’. This allows me to experience other opportunities outside of my employment hours, as it provides me with some time for leisure activities. In agreement with my previous statement, I also chose this path, as a way to further explore my abilities in programming and statistics, as well as my passion for science and learning. 
Lastly, It is important to note that the prospect of new academics in the field will resort in more accurate results regarding the handling of large databases and thus more accurate solutions for various issues, which is referred to in the article ‘Data Science and Prediction’. The result of a larger pool of specialists is the insurance of outcomes with greater accuracy. 
In conclusion, I wish to be part of this unit of professionals, adding to the discovery and innovation within the data science field, whilst allowing to possess all the benefits I have stated above. <p/>

											 <p> Tutor Feedback:Hi,

Thank you for submitting an interesting assignment that I liked reading. Overall, your work on the induction task is excellent. The student has completed the induction module successfully. 

There are a few general comments that will be helpful in future modules.

Written expression and presentation quality:

The student's report is generally well-written, with a brief introduction to the value of higher education and computer science degrees. References are used to elaborate on the significance, which has a positive effect.

Instructions:

The student has followed the instructions

It reflects comprehensive knowledge of the subject and effective use of available resources.  Simple formatting styles should be utilized throughout the report to make it easier to read while also making it appear ordered and professional.

References:

A good reference list is added. The student has correctly included in-text citations in the body of your writing. It's great to have your own thoughts, but demonstrating how they build on or relate to the ideas of others gives your arguments more weight. Academic assessments require that you integrate your work into the work of other authors and provide evidence to support your arguments.

Overall, you've addressed all of the points raised in the assignment question, displaying a thorough comprehension of the task's specific criteria. 

I'd like to congratulate you on passing the module. As you begin your studies at UoE, I wish you the best of luck.
